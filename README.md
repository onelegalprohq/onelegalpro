# OneLegalPro

OneLegalPro is a white-label legal practice management platform built primarily for Thai law firms, Thai lawyers, foreign-owned law firms operating in Thailand, and foreign lawyers working with Thai law. It combines practice management, client communications, a public/client-facing digital presence, and Thailand-first legal intelligence behind a single, Firm-brandable product surface.

This description reflects the approved architecture in [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture) and [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr). It is a description of what OneLegalPro is being built to become, not a claim about what currently runs in production — see [Current project state](#current-project-state) below.

## Current project state

OneLegalPro is in its **architecture-first foundation phase**. Concretely, as of this writing:

- Five architecture tracks are **approved**: ARCH-001 (Thailand-First Legal Intelligence), ARCH-002 (White-Label Platform), ARCH-003 (Communications Hub), ARCH-004 (Website & Client Portal / Digital Presence), and ARCH-005 (Practice Management Core). See [`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) for the authoritative, up-to-date record of what each covers.
- Repository and governance foundation work is **in progress**: Git and repository standards (PF-002) are done, and this repository documentation story (PF-003) is part of that same foundation track.
- Architecture approval does not imply scheduled implementation. **No business module (Legal Intelligence, White-Label rendering, Communications, Digital Presence/Client Portal, or Practice Management) has been implemented yet**, and there is **no production deployment**. Implementation for each epic requires its own approved story in [`docs/implementation/03_Engineering_Backlog.md`](docs/implementation/03_Engineering_Backlog.md).
- A Docker-based development environment and a standardized local-development setup do not exist yet — see [Current limitations](#current-limitations-and-next-foundation-work) below.

For the current story, next story, and full completed/in-progress record, [`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) is authoritative and updated after every completed story.

## Target architecture

The approved architecture commits OneLegalPro to:

- An **enterprise Laravel modular monolith**: business capabilities live in `app/Modules`, shared technical primitives live in `app/Foundation` — see [`docs/domain/06_Laravel_Module_Blueprint.md`](docs/domain/06_Laravel_Module_Blueprint.md).
- **Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture**: a strict `Interface → Application → Domain` dependency direction, framework-independent domain objects, and Eloquent used only for persistence — never for business logic.
- **Law-firm multi-tenancy and Firm isolation**: an explicit `FirmContext` (Firm ID, Actor ID, membership, correlation ID) scopes firm-owned data everywhere, enforced in application logic and repositories, not by global query scopes alone.
- **Security, audit, Ethical Wall, and AI-governance guardrails**: cross-module access only through published contracts, commands, queries, or events; Ethical Wall access checked only through Practice Management's published query; AI output is always advisory, provenance-tagged, and never allowed to silently change authoritative records, bypass access controls, or send client communications without configured human authorization.

The full constitutional rules behind these commitments are in [`docs/architecture/01_OneLegalPro_Constitution.md`](docs/architecture/01_OneLegalPro_Constitution.md).

## Repository map

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | Required reading for any AI coding assistant before changing this repository; lists the source-of-truth documents and per-module rules. |
| [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Git workflow, branch/commit/versioning conventions, PR process, and security/secret-handling rules. |
| [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) | Full, navigable documentation index. |
| [`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) | Authoritative, continuously updated record of current/next story and completed work. |
| [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture) | Approved architecture documents (Constitution, AI Architecture, Roadmap, and the per-epic architecture documents). |
| [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr) | Architecture Decision Records. |
| [`docs/domain/06_Laravel_Module_Blueprint.md`](docs/domain/06_Laravel_Module_Blueprint.md) | How approved architecture maps onto the Laravel modular-monolith structure. |
| [`docs/implementation/01_Implementation_Sprint_Plan.md`](docs/implementation/01_Implementation_Sprint_Plan.md) | Approved delivery sequence (sprints and phases). |
| [`docs/implementation/03_Engineering_Backlog.md`](docs/implementation/03_Engineering_Backlog.md) | Story-level backlog and status within the current epic. |

## Documentation precedence

When documents disagree, `AGENTS.md` establishes the source-of-truth order this repository follows:

1. [`docs/architecture/01_OneLegalPro_Constitution.md`](docs/architecture/01_OneLegalPro_Constitution.md) is constitutional — it prevails over any lower-level architecture, ADR, domain, or implementation document.
2. The rest of [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture) and [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr) govern epic-level and per-decision architecture.
3. [`docs/domain/06_Laravel_Module_Blueprint.md`](docs/domain/06_Laravel_Module_Blueprint.md) governs how that architecture is expressed in code structure.
4. [`docs/implementation/01_Implementation_Sprint_Plan.md`](docs/implementation/01_Implementation_Sprint_Plan.md) and [`docs/implementation/03_Engineering_Backlog.md`](docs/implementation/03_Engineering_Backlog.md) govern approved, scheduled delivery.
5. [`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) reflects current status against that plan.

If a request conflicts with approved architecture, the correct response is to stop and request an architecture decision — not to resolve the conflict unilaterally. See `AGENTS.md` for the full rule set.

## Technology

Verified from [`composer.json`](composer.json) and [`package.json`](package.json):

- **PHP** `^8.3` with **Laravel Framework** `^13.8` and **Laravel Tinker** `^3.0`.
- Development tooling: FakerPHP, Laravel Pail, Laravel Pint, Mockery, Collision, and **PHPUnit** `^12.5.12`.
- Frontend build: **Vite** `^8.0`, **Tailwind CSS** `^4.0`, and the Laravel Vite plugin.
- Composer scripts: `composer run setup` (install, environment bootstrap, key generation, migration, and frontend build), `composer run dev` (concurrent local server, queue listener, log tailing, and Vite), and `composer run test` (config clear plus `artisan test`).
- npm scripts: `npm run dev` (Vite dev server) and `npm run build` (production frontend build).

`composer run setup` is a provisional bootstrap script, not a documented, standardized onboarding workflow — see [Current limitations](#current-limitations-and-next-foundation-work).

## Development workflow

Full detail is in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). In summary:

- Work happens on short-lived feature branches created from `main`; `main` is protected and never receives direct commits.
- **One approved story per pull request** — a PR implements exactly one story ID from [`docs/implementation/03_Engineering_Backlog.md`](docs/implementation/03_Engineering_Backlog.md).
- Every PR uses the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) with its sections intact.
- Human review and approval is required before merge. GitHub's formal approval-count requirement is currently 0 because this is a single-owner repository (GitHub cannot let an author approve their own PR); until a second authorized reviewer exists, human approval is recorded as an explicit review comment on the pull request instead.

## Security and confidentiality

- Never commit credentials, API keys, tokens, secrets, client or matter information, privileged legal content, or production data. `.gitignore` excludes `.env.*` (except `.env.example`) for this reason.
- Never weaken authentication, authorization, Firm isolation, Ethical Walls, encryption, or auditability to make a change easier.
- If a secret is committed accidentally, treat it as compromised, rotate it immediately, and notify the repository owner — a history rewrite alone is not sufficient remediation.
- Report suspected security issues privately to the repository owner rather than in a public issue, per [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Current limitations and next foundation work

- **No Docker development environment yet.** A containerized local environment is tracked as its own upcoming story (Docker Development Environment) and does not exist in this repository today.
- **No standardized local-development environment yet.** The `composer run setup` script provides a provisional bootstrap only; a documented, standardized local-development and configuration workflow is a separate upcoming story (Local Development Environment).
- **No CI or status-check gates are active.** Status checks, commit signing, code scanning, and coverage/quality gates are deferred to their own approved future stories and must not be treated as enforced until those stories configure and verify them — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Track exactly which story is current and what comes next in [`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md).
