# IMP-003 — Engineering Backlog

**Status:** Active  
**Current Epic:** EPIC-001 Platform Foundation

## Story lifecycle

Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Code Review → Architecture Review → QA → Approved → Done

## Definition of Ready

Clear goal, identified owner, resolved dependencies, acceptance criteria, security implications, tests, and no architecture blocker.

## Standard story requirements

Objective, dependencies, deliverables, acceptance criteria, allowed and forbidden files, tests, security, documentation, and Definition of Done.

## Architecture track (parallel to EPIC-001, does not renumber PF-* stories)

- **ARCH-001 — Thailand-First Legal Intelligence Architecture — Done (architecture approved).** Populated `docs/architecture/01_OneLegalPro_Constitution.md`, `docs/architecture/05_AI_Architecture.md`, `docs/architecture/08_Roadmap.md`; created `docs/adr/ADR-002-Thailand-First-Legal-Intelligence.md` (Accepted) and `docs/architecture/09_Legal_Intelligence_Architecture.md`.

# EPIC-002 — Legal Intelligence (proposed, not scheduled)

Architecture is approved (ARCH-001). Implementation is **not yet scheduled** — the staged story list in `docs/architecture/08_Roadmap.md` (jurisdiction foundation, legal-source aggregate and metadata, ingestion pipeline, translation linking, citation engine, disclaimer enforcement, Thai legal search, AI retrieval, court-decision ingestion, firm annotations and saved research, amendment tracking and legal graph) is proposed only. Each stage requires its own approved story entry here, with a Definition of Ready and Definition of Done, before implementation begins. None of these stages carry approved story IDs yet, and none displace or renumber existing `PF-*` stories.
